# Mangadex filter

Filters yaoi-tagged and user-specified series at Mangadex [frontpage](https://mangadex.org/) and [recent updates listing](https://mangadex.org/updates).

## Installation

Get Violentmonkey or Greasemonkey browser extension from Google. Then click [here](https://github.com/nuiva/Mangadex-filter/raw/master/Mangadex-filter.user.js) to install.

## Usage

The yaoi-filter is automatic, but is capped at 1 check every 1.1 seconds to avoid autoban. It seems slow at first, but after you have seen the series once it's cached and faster.

For manual filtering, there are "Filter" buttons near the series name. You can unfilter series at their specific page, e.g., https://mangadex.org/manga/11796

The script includes some tools for bulk filtering, but it's quite messy so I don't recommend looking into it.
