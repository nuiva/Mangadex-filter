# Mangadex filter

Filters manga with certain tags and user-specified manga series at Mangadex [frontpage](https://mangadex.org/) and [recent updates listing](https://mangadex.org/updates).

## Installation

Get Violentmonkey or Greasemonkey browser extension from Google. Then click [here](https://github.com/nuiva/Mangadex-filter/raw/master/Mangadex-filter.user.js) to install.

## Usage

Go to Mangadex [search page](https://mangadex.org/search) to set the tag filters. The toggles are shown next to the included/excluded genres.

Note that there is a 600 requests/10min limit on some Mangadex pages, and this script requests every manga that you have seen **for the first time**. Hence, refreshing all recent updates pages right after installation is not recommended, though no bans have been received yet.

For manual filtering, there are "Filter" buttons near the series name. You can unfilter series at their specific page.

The script includes some tools for bulk filtering, but they are currently out of commission.
